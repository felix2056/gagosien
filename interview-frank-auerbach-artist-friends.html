			<p>One of Britainâs preeminent postwar painters, <strong>Frank Auerbach</strong> was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1931. Arriving in England as a Jewish refugee in 1939, he attended St Martinâs School of Art, London, and studied with David Bomberg in night classes at Borough Polytechnic. He then studied at the Royal College of Art and has remained in London ever since. His first exhibition was held at Londonâs Beaux Arts Gallery in 1956; since then his works have been collected widely. <em>Photo: Â© David Dawson/All rights reserved, 2022/Bridgeman Images</em></p>

		<p><span class="sc">Richard Calvocoressi</span>Frank, can you recount your memories of those John Deakin photographs of you, Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Michael Andrews, and Tim Behrens at Wheelerâs restaurant in Soho in 1963?</p><p><span class="sc">Frank Auerbach</span>I remember every single detail of the photo shoot. Francis Wyndham, one of those people who tended to circulate in Soho, organized it.<a class="fn-ref" id="fn-ref-1" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> There seemed to be some sort of community between Mike, Lucian, Francis, and me, and he suggested that it wouldnât be a bad idea to have a photograph taken of us, as, if not a group, in inverted commas, a sort of coven of artists who congregated to some extent. And he wanted to commission Deakin, who by that time was in a pretty bad way.</p><p>It was arranged that Deakin would photograph us at Wheelerâs at eleven in the morning. Wyndham had thought that Tim Behrens was, as it were, one of usâwhich he wasnât quite. Heâd been a student of Lucianâs and for a time was very friendly with him, but he was of a different generation and didnât take part in the actual continuous conversation that took place between the rest of us.</p><p>So we all turned up at eleven at Wheelerâs. A table had been laid. We sat against the wall and Deakin got up on the bar and started taking a few photographs. And that was more or less it. Francis always hated being associated with other people. He declared he didnât like the whole business. The rest of usâMike, Lucian, and myselfâwere much less pleased to have to go somewhere at eleven in the morning when we would rather be doing something else.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Yes.</p>
	
</div>
			
				
				
				
				<div class="article__text">
	
		<p><span class="sc">FA</span>And when the shoot, which took no more than five minutes, was over, Tim suggested that we open one of the bottles on the table, which nobody wanted to do, but . . . and if anybody had been asked to pay for it, it would certainly have been Francis. So a bottle was opened at Timâs behest, and we may have had a sip of champagne, and then went our separate ways. The photographs were not entirely in focus, and <em>Queen</em> magazine rejected them as not up to their standard. That would have been the end of the story except that one of the photographs resurfaced and itâs now been reproduced about fifty times, as far as I can tell.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Yes, itâs become iconic, to use that overused word.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>In another of them, it looks as if youâre giving Francis Bacon a light.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>I am indeed, yes.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>For someone who would later claim that he never smoked on account of his asthma, I was a bit surprised by that.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>No, no, he smoked. He smoked Gauloises. He smoked them for quite a long time. There was a court case, and it was said that pot had been found in circumstances that cast a slightly dubious light on the policeâI think thereâd been a backstory, somebody wanting to get his own back on Francis phoned the police and said there was pot in his place, and they said they found someâand Francis said at the trial that smoking gave him asthma and therefore he couldnât have smoked pot. But he did in fact smoke. I donât know whether he inhaled, and not very excessively, but he did smoke, yes.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>In Deakinâs photos, you, Bacon, and Andrews are all casually but tidily dressed, while Behrens is the stereotype of the scruffy art student. But Freud, in jacket and tie, looks as if heâs just come from an interview with his bank manager. Was Lucian always dressed so formally outside the studio?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>No. Lucian was sometimes conspicuously scruffy, sometimes in very well-tailored suits. But always with a sense of styleâhe was very conscious of clothes.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Behrens, who looks from the photographs like a sort of hanger-on, and as you say was much younger, was nevertheless very close to Lucian, who painted him a number of times.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Absolutely. Lucian had taken a great interest in Tim when he was a student at the Sladeâhe may in fact still have been a student there when the photographs were takenâand became friendly with him and did some paintings of him. And then, Iâm not sure on what grounds, they had a sort of falling out, which was a falling out both ways.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>I believe around this time, the early â60s, you photographed Deakin.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes, I did take some photographs of Deakin! This was the circumstance: someoneâalmost certainly Francisâasked Deakin for some photos of himself. Deakinâs response was to go across the road to the Golden Lion pubâless crowded than the Colony Roomâand thrust a camera into my hand and ask me to take some snaps. I was totally unfamiliar with cameras.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Moving on to the subject of friendship portraits, if we can call it that, Lucian painted you, he painted a double portrait of Mike and June Andrews, and he also painted Francis. Francis painted Lucian many times. Mike painted miniportraits of both Lucian and Francis in <em>The Colony Room 1</em> (1962). Did you ever paint any of the other three?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Francis also painted a double portrait of Lucian and myself.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Of course, itâs in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>It was done from photographs in <em>Paris Match</em> of French soldiers relaxing in Algiers, as you might expect. I suppose it registers, for me, as a painting rather than a portrait.</p><p>I did a drawing and an etching of Lucian, but I never painted either Mike or Francis, although I painted a number of pictures of Leon Kossoff, who, simply because his lifestyle was different, was not a great habituÃ© of Soho. Even before he was married, he always had a more domestic background. The people who tended to drink in Soho were people who didnât really have whatâs called homes.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>What are your memories of sitting for Lucian?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>I sat for Lucian in one of his very run-down apartments, in a condemned terrace of empty houses. I sat for three hours at a time, I donât know how many sittings. Lucian would, I thinkâmemory failsâgive me a lift at both ends. It was always very well heated and warm and there was often a restaurant meal afterwards, four times out of five paid for by Lucian. The whole process of painting from a person is so very familiar to me that I cannot remember anything as being remarkable.</p><p>Lucian sat for me in my studio for the drawing, and did a surprising number of sittingsâperhaps fifteenâfor the little etching in his Holland Park flat.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>By 1963, when Deakinâs photos were taken, Bacon was already quite famous, having had a big retrospective at the Tate.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Oh, he was almost like Dylan Thomas: as soon as he appeared he was famous. People regarded him as quite remarkable and on a different level from almost the whole of current English painting. The fact that his audience grew is true, but the quality of his reputation was there from the very, very beginning. It has to be remembered that the painting that the Museum of Modern Art in New York bought was bought before any retrospectiveâperhaps from his second show at the Hanover, or even from his first, after the war.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span><em>Painting</em> (1946), the one with the umbrella?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Thatâs right, yes.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>I think the museum bought it from the Hanover in 1948.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes. Alfred Barr may have been a genius among twentieth-century curators in the English-speaking world. In the late 1940s or early 1950s he acquired some small paintings of Lucianâs before there was any question of his having any sort of international standing or fame.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Of the three of themâLucian, Francis, and Mikeâwho were you closest to, or did the relationships change over the years?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>They certainly changed over the years, in the sense that Francis fell out with all of us. But for a time I was closest to Francisâsome of this sounds self-serving but itâs absolutely true. He was, from the beginning, quite interested in what I had to sayâor so he saidâand after my first show he went out of his way to get to know me. He arranged with Helen Lessore that we should all three of us go together to the premiere of the film that Eduardo Paolozzi and Mike were inâ</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Oh yes, <em>Together</em>.<a class="fn-ref" id="fn-ref-2" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>

		<p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes. Weâd spoken before but he wanted to be formally introduced. And he took us to Wheelerâs afterwards. Then, for about fifteen years, we spoke frequently, and probably incoherently, but I think with a sense of mutual stimulation. In fact I remember one occasion, after a meal with Francis and Lucian, when Lucian said he was so stimulated by Francisâs and my conversation that he rushed home and went on with his painting in the middle of the night.</p><p>This persisted for some time, and Francis was extraordinarily kind to me in many ways. I lived in . . . I guess youâd call it rock-bottom poverty, and he took me to many, many meals. But then he fell out with all of us. I think with me firstâI think he got fed up with me and my work. I very slightly got fed up with him as well, after about fifteen years.</p><p>With Lucian it was more complicated because they were the two closest. I might have seen Francis twice a week for about fifteen years, but Lucian and Francis were together all day, when they werenât working, for a very considerable time, and it was very rare to see one without the other. Francis expressed a sort of polite respect for Lucianâs work. Lucian was totally loyal to Francis and was clearly fascinated by his work and admired it. But as was Francisâs wont, whenever Lucian had a show, he would go and start telling people it wasnât really the sort of thing he liked, he preferred [Walter] Sickert really, this looked like Stanley Spencer, he didnât care for it, and so on.</p><p>But I think Francis was stimulated by, as it were, cutting himself off and being on his own, and very often spoke of the delights of treachery, which to some extent he practiced. It has to be said that this was run concurrently with extreme generosity and friendliness, and in fact, in my case, before we fell out, he was very helpfulâI mean, I think he told people about my work a bit and perhaps persuaded one or two people to buy it, and may have even praised it for a while. But then he got fed up with it. And he got fed up with Lucian too, later, and he got fed up with Mike as well, although for a time heâd admired his work. Iâm probably overinterpreting, but I think Francis felt stifled by having too close a relationship of that sort. And the people he was more at ease with were people like Miss Beston at the Marlborough, Sonia Orwell, his nannyâthat is, friends who were in a different sphere.<a class="fn-ref" id="fn-ref-3" href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a> He sometimes said, since he was inclined to be provocative, that he preferred what he called ordinary people to artists.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>For those fifteen years when you and Francis spoke consistently, what were the sorts of topics that you covered?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Well, that was the trouble, you see, when I was told we would do this interview, I found it very difficult to remember. We spoke about painting. We spoke also about literature and gossip and all sorts of things. It wasnât in any sense structured. We never had, as it were, a debate about painting. You canât say that this was artists discussing art. It wasnât quite like that. There were implications of certain standards of extremism, a certain disdain for painting as being in any sense of social value or something that makes life more pleasant or anything like icing on the cake. And I think it touched on poetry and literature as much as it did on painting. I mean, we spoke a great deal about, I donât know, Yeats and things. But it was more gossip and jokes and so on. For Godâs sake, donât represent it as like Van Gogh and Gauguin seriously discussing art! There was no discussion of that sort. We were in the same ambiance. We kept seeing each other because presumably we felt there was some sort of sympathetic community. We talked of everything under the sun, and by implication, something fairly ambitious in all four of our attitudes to painting was part of the undercurrent. Mike had immaculate manners but underneath this mask he was intensely ambitious, as was evident in the fact that, right from the very beginning, he was clearly focused on painting large masterpieces of National Gallery quality.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Were the four of you competitive?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>I think we were more competitive than cooperativeâthere was obviously a bit of both. But I think the basis of the association was a feeling that the others were worth contending with.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>So if you were influenced by each other at all, it was really lifestyle and behavior rather than each otherâs painting.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Exactly. I mean, when I was younger and even more callow than I am now, I found Lucianâs idiom, and particularly his use of the sable brushâthe intense clarity of his early idiomâand indeed Francisâs idiom, what seemed to me slightly vaporous, sensational, unstructured: I rejected both. And then I gradually began to accept and admire their work because I realized as I grew up that it wasnât a question of idiom but of intensity and range of sensibility.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Given that figurative painting went out of fashion in the late 1960s, early 1970s, with the rise of Minimal, Conceptual, politicized art, and so on, what did the four of you feel? Isolated and unloved? A dying breed? Or something like a sect whose time would come?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>I think we all took a longer view. It may be pretentious but Iâm all for pretensionâit gives one something to live up toâbut we all, while interested in everything that was going on in art, related in our own ways to the <em>whole history</em> of art. That is, we noticed, oh, [Jean] Dubuffet, [Henri] Michaux, Yves Klein, [Jackson] Pollock etc., etc. I donât think we thought of all that as necessarily comprehensive, but in our own way we were all aware of history. Lucian, quite broad-minded, related to <em>all</em> first-class art ever made. Of course, the tradition has always been, in Ezra Poundâs words, âMake it new.â Itâs now almost two centuries since Baudelaire suggested that the phrase âavant-gardeâ should be given back to the military and that we should look for the <em>absolutely new</em> (which is slightly harder to detect). Paul ValÃ©ryâs claim that âThe new is always the oldâ is a typical French paradox but one can sense a meaning.</p><p>Francisâs behavior was very grand, he simply didnât waste any energy on telling people what he thought of Pop art and so on. Possibly sometimes in an aside, he would say somethingâI may say totally mistakenlyâderogatory about David Hockney, whoâs a rather remarkable painter in my opinion. It was quite clear that Francis was certain that if you painted well enough, if you made a great image, that was all that was necessary. You didnât have to take notice of what was going on around you.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>Yet, of all of you, he seems to have been more intrigued and open to including passages of what one might call abstract painting, large flat areas of a single color, even though he was at the same time decrying abstraction.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Well, weâre all affected by what goes on, whether weâre aware of it or not. But I think itâs a little simplistic to think that when he went down to Cornwall and saw Patrick Heron cover a canvas with orange, he was affected by it. Francis was enormously inventive. His avatar, his model, would be Picasso, really, if it was anybody. And in the same way Picasso can in some moods be regarded as the greatest artist who ever lived, in the sense that he made radical images at various points of his life, Francis too, as soon as heâd done somethingâI think this is true of most artistsâhe wanted to do exactly the opposite.</p><p>Francis was fairly contemptuous of most of his contemporaries, actually. He might have been affected by anything he saw out of the corner of his eye, including furniture in a shop window, but I donât think he would have been influenced by anybody. I remember him once pointing out to me in the National Portrait Gallery a portrait of James Joyce by Jacques-Ãmile Blancheânot in my opinion a tremendously distinguished painting, but he liked the way the paint had been put on in the background and he went on about it as though it actually mattered to him. So anything could affect him. But I donât think thereâs anything linear about influences being exchanged in that way with English paintingâparticularly since he always had a greater respect for French thought, and spoke French fluently. Michel Leiris and Alberto Giacometti and so on became people he spoke to a lot, and I think Georges Batailleâthat was all part of his background.</p><p>Looking back, Iâm struck by the extraordinary reasonableness and honesty and clarity and modesty of whatever Lucian said. He was very lively as far as gossip and life were concerned, it was full of interest and excitement. He didnât make many pronouncements about painting but when he did, they were fairly simple and always worth listening to.</p><p>So we did have an effect on each other, but I donât think it was anyâthere was no particular community between us. As I said, Francisâs habitual tendency towards treachery was combined with extraordinary generosity and sympathy. I mean, he gave money away and performed many acts of extreme kindness. It made him, I think, what he wanted it to make himâon his own and not part of any sort of gang.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>In his landscapes of the 1970s and â80s, Mike Andrews used a spray gun to cover or stain large areas of unprimed canvas with acrylic paint. Bacon also, I think, used an aerosol spray in his pictures of sand dunes and jets of water. Were you ever tempted to experiment technically in this way, or does working from the live modelâas opposed to photographs, like Bacon and Andrewsâpreclude this?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>I was never tempted to use a spray gun. I think, or feel, that for me, painting is a form of drawing. But the use of painting is always experimental, different every time.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>What about art criticsâDavid Sylvester, for example? Did he help to sustain this idea of an association or group? He wrote about all of you quite positively, I think.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes, I think he wrote about Lucian positively at the very beginning and then turned against him. He certainly wrote positively about Mike, but I think turned against him as well. And the same was true of me. But I think Francis and David were quite closeâIâm making everything complicated because Francis would seem and be extremely friendly with people and then run them down behind their back. But I think he respected David Sylvesterâs intelligence, and what I think of as the admirable clarity of his prose, which seemed to me very simple and direct. I think they worked together on that book of interviewsâI think Francis had very considerable input. He always said that he didnât take any notice, this all happened behind his back, but I think he worked on the book with David over a period of time. And like many things in life, when I first read it, I was excited about it. When I read it again ten years ago, I thought Francis was talking for effect. When I read it again recently, it seemed rather good again. Francis was quite frank about âWho canât you tear apart if not your friends?â So all of his friendships had this ambivalence about them. But I think he was close to David.</p><p>And as far as I was concerned, David, by himself and without being told, seemed to respond to my first show. He liked me for some time, and then I think he hoped that I would become something like an American painter who had an artistic profile that he held to throughout his life. Whereas I donât think I would have liked to be [Mark] Rothko, for all his talent. As my work developed, it seemed to trace a certain autobiographical line that wasnâtâIâm interpretingâentirely the sort of thing that David Sylvester went for.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>You all identified very closely with London as a setting for living, and also as a subject. I think only Mike left London for the countryâin the late 1970sâand didnât return for another fifteen years.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Well, Francis was always going on about how heâd like to move to Paris because thatâs where the center of corruption was. I donât think that Francis painted London particularly, although all those men in suits somehow seem rather English. But I donât think there was an avowed attachment to London. There certainly was in my case and in Lucianâs case, for the quite obvious reason that, you know, we clung to it as a raft in the sea, that weâd come here from somewhere weâd escaped. This meant survival for us, really, London. And of course, in London, particularly after the war, there was a curious feeling of equality and freedom, because weâd all survived the war and nothing else was all that important. It had a feeling of adventure and freedom and unconstraint and a sort ofânot that I particularly believe in equalityâa sort of equality, that anybody could be anybody. Gradually, of course, everything became stratified again. Before the war, it was largely on the basis of class; after the war, I think to a very large extent on the basis of money.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>Of the four, you were the one who painted images of London postwar, the period of destruction and reconstruction.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes, and Leon Kossoff too. But I mean, you would have to be totally insensitive not toâif you went on the bus, you saw these wrecked buildings all around, deep holes in the ground, five stories with fireplaces and pictures on the wall and the rooms sheared away, great heaps of rubble everywhere. It wasnât that different from the photographs you get now of Ukraine.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>In Lucianâs paintings, you get glimpses of down-at-heel parts of the city such as Paddington, through windows and so on.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes. And he painted a waste ground or two as well. Thereâs a feeling of time in Lucianâs immediate postwar work: everything seems to be unstratified and loose before it all settles down again.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>Both Francis and Mike died in the early 1990s. You continued I think to see Lucian on a regular basis until his death.</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Yes, I did. I was very fond of Lucian. Apart from the fact that we had quite a lot in common (weâd both been to the same sort of school, and had the same sort of background, and our families in Berlin had known each other), I found Lucian quite exceptionally nice, an exceptionally sweet man, and a good friend, and very frank and honest and everything one could wish for in a friend. He would sometimes ask me to go round and see what heâd done, and I used to do that. I saw him frequently.</p><p>And Mike, I liked Mike very much as well. We certainly never fell out. We saw each other more rarelyâI had dinner there once or twice, he had dinner with us once or twice. We met in Soho. I think he knew that I respected and admired his work. But even during the time that I saw him frequently, I didnât see him quite as frequently as I saw Francis, and certainly not as frequently as I saw Lucian for something like fifty or sixty years.</p><p><span class="sc">RC</span>And I believe Bruce Bernard was a mutual friend ofâ</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Absolutely, of all of us, yes. He took a photograph of me a week before he died. I thought it was a very good photograph. He was already extremely feeble. Virginia Verran came with him. He couldnât actually set up the camera tripod by himself, and I remember Virginia quietly doing everything for him, everything physical, and then squatting in the corner as though she wasnât there in the studio. And he took this photograph, which was I think quite a good photograph. Itâs got me in the mirror and thereâs almost like a hangmanâs noose hanging over my head.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">RC</span>How did Lucianâs large collection of your work come about?</p><p><span class="sc">FA</span>Well, he said it was his taste.
