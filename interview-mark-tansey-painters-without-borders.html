		<p><span class="sc">Peter Drake</span> <em>Figurative Diaspora</em>, at the New York Academy of Art in early 2018, was in some ways motivated by the <em>Transformations</em> exhibition that Mark Tansey put together back in 1994. It was hosted in his apartment and consisted of four Chinese Socialist Realist artists: Liu Xiaodong, Chen Danqing, Yu Hong, and Ni Jun. In <em>Figurative Diaspora&nbsp;</em>there is a notion that while a visual language was marginalized in the United States and Western Europe, it was also migrating across cultures, still being preserved to a degree in the East. There, reanimated as propaganda, this language was kept alive.</p><p>Vitaly, you were the one who originally introduced Mark to these artists, so maybe you can explain how you first encountered their work.</p><p><span class="sc">Vitaly Komar</span>At that time, Alexander Melamid and I published a call to artists in <em>Artforum</em> magazine. We asked for proposals of what to do with Soviet communist-era monuments or Socialist monuments to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Russia started to destroy these monuments in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Artists from countries including Germany, China, and Russia responded to this. Our studio became a kind of meeting place.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>When you saw work by the Chinese artists, did you immediately recognize traces of the education that you had received in Russia?</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>Yes. Moscow represented a traditional Western academy for China in the same way that Rome did for Russian artists in the nineteenth century, when Russian artists were moving to Rome to study the Renaissance and Baroque periods.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Mark, were you and Vitaly friends at that point?</p><p><span class="sc">Mark Tansey</span>Yes, we had met. I very much admired Komar and Melamid’s work and how they had internalized critical content in the Socialist Realist form.</p><p><span class="sc"><span>PD</span></span> Were you ever in a studio of theirs at the time?</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>The first time I visited their studio was for one of the evening meetings Vitaly mentioned earlier. That’s where I first saw slides of Chen Danqing’s pictures and was introduced to him.</p><p><span class="sc"><span>PD</span></span> Danqing was living in the States for about twenty years, wasn’t he?</p><p><span class="sc">Xin Wang</span>He came in 1982.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>I remember a very striking painting by Danqing, of a field worker listening to a radio announce the death of Chairman Mao. It struck me.</p><p><span class="sc">Jane DeBevoise</span>It’s an interesting early work of his that was shown at the Guggenheim Museum in 1998 in the exhibition <em>A Century in Crisis: Modernity and Tradition in the Art of Twentieth-Century China</em>.</p><p><span class="sc"><span>MT</span></span> I was intrigued by the idea of presenting the unpresentable, of visualizing the auditory. That goes beyond realism, it gets to realization, it’s where things come together.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>In your essay for the <em>Transformations</em> booklet, you said, “Chen’s work served as an introduction to me to the works of Liu Xiaodong, Yu Hong, and Ni Jun. And this transformational edge in his work led me to appreciate the importance of understanding their work in terms of extending temporal transformations of their culture rather than the narrow temporal postures of mine.” You were seeing it through a very particular point of view and it took you a while to adjust.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>It was common at that time to view contemporary art as existing in a singular, formal present. But apprehending the art of Chen Danqing or Komar and Melamid involved multiple times, multiple styles, and multiple relations between form and content.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Mark, I remember going to that show in your apartment and needing you to guide me on understanding why Yu Hong’s work was progressive because when I saw it, I thought it was just pictures of women. There was nothing about it that struck me as progressive until you put it in the context of Socialist Realist work, and then suddenly it felt extremely unusual but also refreshing, even potentially dangerous.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">MT</span>Her painting involved self-representation with a sensitive exuberance that was well beyond the agenda of Socialist Realism.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Xin, do you know if the Chinese artists were puzzled by the American reactions to their work? I’ve heard that Chen Danqing was disappointed that the level of success he had achieved in China was so different from what he was achieving in America.</p><p><span class="sc">XW</span>I wouldn’t even say he <em>had</em> an American reception, because there was a lack of any mainstream recognition of these artists at the time, before contemporary Chinese art started appearing in major museum exhibitions in the 1990s and subsequently as an art-market phenomenon in the mid-2000s. I don’t know what kind of feedback they got from the <em>Transformations</em> exhibition because that was a more intimate crowd of people who probably understood them on some level. After moving back to China, Chen Danqing published several extremely popular memoirs and essays about his time in New York, and one of these chapters was dedicated to his friendship with Mark. In this essay and others, he wrote candidly about his frustrations but also offered insightful observations about anachronisms of the New York art world, its hierarchies, and how it functioned to distinguish the “mainstream” and the peripheral practices—a category as much stylistic and temporal as historical. He was so amazed that Mark took an interest in the realist works by him and other Chinese artists and offered to reflect on their practices in an exhibition context.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong have had phenomenal success as artists. Was any part of that due to <em>Transformations</em>? Did a kind of bump happen afterward?</p><p><span class="sc">JDB</span>Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong’s acceptance and celebration have grown significantly since the 1990s, but I feel their audience is still mostly Chinese. Mainland Chinese are wealthier than they were in the 1990s, and some have embraced these academically trained artists, particularly those who work with fairly anodyne subject matter—beautiful women, for example, or nostalgic scenes of an old Shanghai. But Liu Xiaodong is different; he often works with dystopic Beijing scenes—gritty city streets and displaced people. His painting skills are so good, it would be hard for Western and Chinese audiences not to take note, but even so, in general I’d say he’s not as widely recognized in the West as he is in China.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Even though he’s represented by a powerful American gallery, his audience is still mostly Chinese based.</p><p><span class="sc">JDB</span>Yes, that’s my feeling. The big change in visibility around these artists—at least in the last ten to fifteen years, and particularly for those who retain a closer connection to the Socialist Realist tradition—is that Chinese audiences have grown significantly. And now these audiences not only have the means to collect, they also understand the grammar and the tradition. They see where it’s coming from. They respect the academic training and recognize the controversial aspects of what the artists are doing to disturb or subvert it. They see the critique, while Westerners disregard it or don’t understand the context from which it emerges. I suspect that in the ’80s and ’90s, when these artists arrived in New York, some of them might have felt somewhat frustrated, as many had already been highly recognized in China. That may have been discouraging, but in some ways it was good because many went back to China and did great things there. For example, Ai Weiwei was more or less working in obscurity when he lived in New York in the ’80s. It wasn’t until he went back to China in the ’90s that his career as an artist and instigator began to take off.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">VK</span>When I came to the United States, I tried to understand the echoes of the past, the realistic and academic art in the West. In Russia during the first years of the revolution an academic system of education was destroyed as a bourgeois tradition. It was rebuilt in the beginning of the ’30s. Simultaneously, Germany established a totalitarian academy of art. The Bauhaus was destroyed and instead National Socialists started to rebuild the tradition of “the hero.”</p><p>I understood the history of twentieth-century art as not just the history of Cubism, abstract art, and Abstract Expressionism but also of totalitarian art, which was occurring in Spain and Italy as well. Chinese and Tibetan art were proto-abstract geometry. Abstract Expressionism couldn’t be popular [in China] because Chinese hieroglyphs are by concept, by origin, the same as Abstract Expressionism. That’s why Chinese artists themselves were attracted by the realistic depiction of nature, and to poetry, and sometimes combined the two. That’s one way to understand why the tradition of realism was so popular and is still popular in China.</p><p>In Russia, there was a different reason for the explosion of academic art. The height of Russian art was during the end of nineteenth-century symbolism. It was famous, even in Europe. The idea of depicting another, imaginary world was reflected in the communist idea of building another world, a new world, an ideal society on this earth. It was a great illusion, which ended tragically in Russia. It was a tragic lesson to all humanity because sometimes it’s very dangerous to turn a fairy tale into reality.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>Part of what you’re known for, especially when you were collaborating with Alexander, was an ironic repurposing of the grammar of Soviet Socialist Realism. That’s been a thread through your work—using this language, repurposing tropes from the ’50s, from the film world, from illustration, from art history, and turning them on their heads. Mark, was that something you found in the work by the Chinese artists?</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>Danqing’s work in particular involved cross-cultural juxtaposing and repurposing of images of different times.

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>From the New York Academy of Art’s point of view, our interest in <em>Figurative Diaspora</em> is this notion that a certain language, while it was marginalized in the US and Western Europe, could be migrating across cultures, being preserved and reenlivened, even though it was being repurposed for propaganda. This language was kept alive, which explains why artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing have a phenomenal skill set.

		<p><span class="sc">JDB</span>The continuation of figuration and realism and their pervasiveness outside the Euro-American sphere is something that fascinates me. It proposes a certain kind of resistance to the mainstream as we have developed it, this hegemonic view of what is and what is not art. There is a Euro-American modernism, and then there is modernity, and then there is the socialist modernity. We don’t seem to adequately acknowledge that modernity comes in different packages, and that socialist modernity is just as relevant to world culture as Euro-American modernity yet is almost never embraced, almost never validated in Euro-American institutions. Whatever we think about totalitarianism, there is something within the wreckage of Mao’s socialism that still resonates in the minds and hearts of many artists in China. Acknowledging that may make artwork by people like Yu Hong or Liu Xiaodong more legible and clarify their desire to continue to communicate broadly. It may be interesting to think through realism and figuration in a broader, more ideological sense, as well as an<br>artistic sense.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Part of that must be how the avant-garde positioned itself in the culture, wanting to be exclusive and not for the masses. To a certain degree there was a kind of intellectual elitism that was not interested in speaking to the average person. The notion of communication to a broader audience, whether it’s through Socialist Realism or any other form of realism, is sort of antithetical to the avant-garde.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">VK</span>In Russia, the avant-garde ended in the late 1920s, when it lost the ability to attract official power within the government. From the beginning, they’d said the masses did not understand the abstract art of Kazimir Malevich and the others. At a certain point, even Malevich started to paint realistically.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>De Chirico changes also, a little earlier.</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>There was a tendency to change in search of the “new.” Paradoxically, realism became new for a short time at the end of the ’20s, beginning of the ’30s. Nowadays we have an entirely new situation, where all kinds of art coexist. Just take a walk in Chelsea and you will see video art, realist art, photographs, abstract expressionism, abstract geometry, surrealism, etc. That means our criteria of what’s good in art has opened up. We have become tolerant of many contradictions.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>But that also creates a critical crisis.</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>Sometimes crisis is the period before you go back to health.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Jane, it’s interesting that in contemporary Chinese art, particularly with the artists who were in <em>Transformations</em>, there remains a strong attachment to realism.

		<p><span class="sc">JDB</span>We just had a show of contemporary Chinese art at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. It’s interesting to note that the curators of this show made a choice to omit painting, at least for the most part. Among the paintings that <em>were</em> included were works by Yu Hong, Liu Xiaodong, and a few others, but the core of the exhibition relied on other media—installation, performance, and video. We should remember, however, that many of the artists in that exhibition started out as painters and have retained the skills you mentioned. They are academically trained artists from the Central Academy in Beijing, or the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou, for instance. Behind the conceptual art that the Guggenheim curators decided to present are amazing realist painting-and-drawing skills.</p><p>After June 4, 1989, and through much of the 1990s in China, public museums, which were almost entirely state run, were prohibited from displaying so-called avant-garde art, exemplified by much of the work that you saw at the Guggenheim. Artists like Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong, both students and young teachers at the Central Academy in the late 1980s and ’90s, may have wanted to continue to exhibit their work publicly, to continue their conversation with the public. In one of his essays Vitaly used the term “official conceptualism,” which I thought was lovely. Is that what we have here?</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>Wasn’t it also true that Yu Hong was taking some chances with her own career?</p><p><span class="sc">JDB</span>Yes, but she stayed with a more traditional-looking vocabulary and she perfected it. As did Liu Xiaodong. They were truth-tellers in the sense that they were showing a Beijing that was not bright, shiny, and red, required characteristics of politically acceptable art during the strident Maoist years. That willingness to tell the truth was controversial within a mainstream context. For example, one work by Liu Xiaodong in the recent Guggenheim show showed two boys, <em>liúmáng</em> or hoodlums, burning a rat—marginalized, unemployed guys hanging around, doing nothing, being bored, and burning a rat. That was the flip side of the new economy that was beginning to surge. People were going to be left behind. Liu Xiaodong communicated this new reality in a language that was at once legible and unsettling.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>That’s one of the aspects I was attracted to in Lu Liang’s work too. He does these incredibly bleak pictures of ghost cities and strange vistas, on an enormous scale, you feel like you’re stepping into reality in a strange way. All the skill sets are there. He’s using everything he’s learned and deploying it to make a very dark statement. But they’re still incredibly beautiful, hauntingly so.</p><p><span class="sc">JDB</span>That duality is embedded in the work of a lot of artists who want to maintain a certain kind of visibility, or work within the system, and yet at the same time feel deeply about the social problems in China.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>In America, earlier generations of conceptual artists have now become deeply embedded in academic life and there seems to be little interest in technical training. It’s a very strange moment. These are people who took chances with their creative lives, saw themselves as progressive, but then institutionalized their beliefs. You go around the country now and even foundation programs are being done away with. And there’s very little room for that training in the larger art marketplace. It’s an entirely different sort of institutional culture.</p><p><span class="sc">XW</span>At the same time, it feels like a familiar story, where progressive and democratizing goals almost inevitably become institutionalized. I think what Jane has just laid out about China specifically is important because it’s not just about preserving something—a tradition or a genre—it’s also about expanding and transvaluing it into something completely different, often in response to changing times and cultural/political climates.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>That’s the most important thing. Part of what’s frightening about traditional atelier practice is that the drawings that come out of it frequently look very similar. But in China at the moment, you don’t actually see this salon sensibility of just repeating the past, you see really great figurative work, and it’s looking to the future. It’s taking advantage of all these linguistic skills but deploying them in ways that haven’t been seen before. It’s fascinating and exciting.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">JDB</span>It’s interesting to consider the community of Chinese artists who came to New York around the time of Mark’s <em>Transformations</em> exhibition, a community that included both Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaodong. On one hand, they came from a similar milieu and were friendly colleagues in New York, yet there’s a divide in terms of their approach toward the system. Vitaly, when people from Russia first came to the United States, did that same sense of community pervade?</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>I guess it depends on how long you stayed in New York.</p><p><span class="sc">Heidi Elbers</span>Vitaly, Chinese artists exhibited in Moscow when you were studying.

It was a more provocative time.</p><p><span class="sc">XW</span>Mark, you were very tuned in to unpacking something about these Chinese artists, and you mentioned the conceptual and perceptual in our previous conversations. That seems to be the duality where irony or ironic meanings would manifest. Interestingly enough, however, in these Chinese artists’ works, there is not the same kind of irony that you practice or subscribe to in your work.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>I’m not sure to what degree irony overlaps with humor or satire. There is an outward aggression in humor that can be alleviated by laughter. But Vitaly had said recently that irony is “related to the idea of self-reflection.” That’s what I saw vividly, in multiple senses, in the work of the Chinese artists.</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>Sometimes I feel that my self-irony is very close to self-destruction. Because in purifying yourself you’re also losing part of yourself.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">PD</span>There’s a certain kind of disenchanted idealism that uses irony to sort of attack one’s previous faith. Mark, do you feel that the word “irony” implies a lack of faith, or a lack of authenticity?</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>It seems inadequate to try to put a tight definition on it. Satirical artwork, humor, visualizing irony—there are relationships that are volatile, beautiful, and funny at times, but how they come together is quite explosive, an enigma.</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>“Explosive” is a good term.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>That’s funny, because I remember back when critics felt your art depended on one-liners, so you started to embed text in your work.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>I realized that text as texture can become picture.</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span> They didn’t see the complexity of the work. They weren’t willing to invest themselves in decoding its complexity.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>At that time, even though a lot of attention was certainly given to representational artists, the critique of representation had it that representational meanings were “single coded,” “single messaged,” and “totalizing.” But if you go beyond that reductive thinking it becomes apparent that there is inherent complexity in how the perceptual and the conceptual interact with the making of a representational picture. That’s the vitality of the figurative, you’re not re-presenting anything literally—you’re re-presenting, metaphorically. It’s about the interaction of seeing, thinking, and making. And when I see people doing it with verve, it’s a pleasure. It can be dangerous, satirical, ironic, critical, insightful, revelatory. . . .</p><p><span class="sc">VK</span>Also sometimes sarcastic.</p><p><span class="sc">MT</span>Its many reflective modes show the adequacy of representation as a form of signification.</p><p><span class="sc">HE</span>Peter and Mark, you have been working toward the <em>Figurative Diaspora</em> exhibition for quite a while. Can you talk about your thought process?</p><p><span class="sc">PD</span>At the start we wanted to focus on technical sophistication, but over ten or fifteen years, the proposition changed dramatically, and now it’s something more like traditional skills and contemporary discourse. The artists in both <em>Transformations</em> and <em>Figurative Diaspora</em> have made an enormous effort to acquire an incredibly difficult set of skills, and they’re trying to do something progressive, something that hasn’t been seen before. Part of what makes their work so interesting is that the language has morphed as it has moved along. Some of the tropes from Soviet Socialist Realism still show up—you’ll see figures portrayed from below, or lit with artificial light. But those devices are used in different ways now, and it feels like there’s a real connection between all three cultures.</p>
