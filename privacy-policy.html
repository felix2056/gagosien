Gagosien may reject, delay, or remove content from emails that may disrupt our systems or that pose security issues such as viruses.</p><p>We may also filter out emails that contain content considered offensive, unwanted, or spam. In certain circumstances, this may affect “innocent” emails. We do our best to reduce such occurrences.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>Gagosien has developed and implemented strict policies and processes governing information technology and data-user behavior. These cover areas such as access control, authentication, audit, monitoring, alarms, data storage and backup, transmission standards, and environment integrity.</p><p>We use reasonable efforts to install and have appropriate security measures in place in our systems and facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p><p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or the use of data in a particular service, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@gagosian.com">privacy@gagosian.com</a> or call us toll-free at +1 866 467 8688 (service code: 829).</p><p>Last Updated: November 10, 2022</p>
